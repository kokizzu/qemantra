* Qemantra
Qemantra is a cli for creating and running QEMU Virtual Machines.

** Motivation ?
Virtualbox is good, but it has a QT interface and it's command line inteface is hectic at best.
QEMU has no official (or good) frontend , the command line interface is mature , but has no central managing solution.

Qemantra aims to become a simple and convinient way to manage Virtual Machines. It is designed for the casual Virtualizer
who struggles to control their VM's using the command line.

** Installation ?
Currently you can only build from source.
- Clone the repository
- ~make build~ to build the binary.
- Move the binary to a folder in your $PATH variable.

** Features
- Create , list and run virtual machines.
- Create configurations to run on demand.
- Use features of QEMU like KVM , multiple architecture support etc.
