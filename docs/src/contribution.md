# How to contribute

We always welcome all types of contribution. 

You are welcome to browse the `issues` on GitHub and we may help you to make your first contribution!

You should be able to operate `git` and able to make a PR. It does not matter if you don't know `golang` or can't help technically.
We generally have non-technical work to be completed.
