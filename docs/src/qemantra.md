# `qemantra`

`qemantra` is a command line tool to manage virtual machines running on top on KVM/QEMU.
It serves to be a alternative to the GUI tools like `virt-manager`.

## `how can this be used ?`

- Start, configure and run VM's from the terminal.
- Integrate `qemantra` inside tools to automate Virtual Machine based tasks.

## `depdencies`

For obvious reasons `qemantra` depends on `QEMU`. 

If you want to enable UEFI inside Virtual Machines you will also need the `ovmf` package.

## `installation` 

Right now this can be installed by directly downloading the latest release tarball.
