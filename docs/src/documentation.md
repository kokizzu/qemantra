# Documentation

This website is the documentation for `qemantra`. 
It uses `mdbook` and `markdown` to generate this website.
For the gifs, we use [`vhs`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs).

For obvious reasons you should be comfortable with these tools before contributing.

Any positive changes to the documentation are welcome!

Just file a issue and drop a PR [here](https://github.com/pspiagicw/qemantra).
