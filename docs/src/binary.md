# Binary Installation

You can download a binary from the releases section on [GitHub]().

Move it to a folder on your PATH.

Or use this [script]().

Run this command to download the script and install it automatically.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pspiagicw/qemantra/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This script would detect your system and download the appropirate binary and install it in  `/usr/local/bin/`.

If possible it would also install manpages and other meta information.
